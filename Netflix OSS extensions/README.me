The Netflix OSS extension comes already pre-installed with Dynatrace. You'll find it under Settings --> Monitored technologies --> Supported technologies.
Please, do not try to install the file provided here as an extension manually, as it is probably not up-to-date with the current level of functionality.

Thanks!
